# Control Construct Implementation

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Control Construct Implementation project! This project focuses on demonstrating and implementing various control constructs found in programming languages. Control constructs are essential for managing the flow of a program, making decisions, and iterating through data.

## Implemented Control Constructs

Specify the control constructs that you are implementing. Examples include:

- **If Statements:** Implement conditional statements for decision-making.
- **Switch Statements:** Implement a switch or case-based statement for multiple branches.
- **Loops (For, While, Do-While):** Demonstrate different types of loops for iteration.
- 
## Features

- **Visual Representation:** If applicable, provide a visual representation of the control constructs through diagrams or code snippets.
- **Example Usage:** Include examples demonstrating the usage of each implemented control construct.

## Project Structure

Describe the structure of your project, including the main classes and their functionalities. For example:

- `IfStatementExample.java`: Contains examples demonstrating the usage of if statements.
- `SwitchStatementExample.java`: Demonstrates the usage of switch statements.
- `LoopExamples.java`: Includes examples of various loops.

## Code Snippets

Include code snippets to illustrate how each control construct is implemented.

```java
// Example of If Statement
if (condition) {
    // Code to execute if the condition is true
} else {
    // Code to execute if the condition is false
}
